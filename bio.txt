I am back in school after working in the Social Work/Social Welfare realm for the past 20+ years. I most recently (for the past 16 years) oversaw state grants for community colleges, helping many low-income, dislocated workers, and displaced homemakers find funding to attend school. After being laid off myself, I am using Worker Retraining funding (which is one of the grants I oversaw at Wenatchee Valley College and worked with while employed at SkillSource) to help me get some basic foundational knowledge in Computer Programming. I look forward to meeting you and working with you!
I attended University of Washington, which is where I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Social Work/Social Welfare.
