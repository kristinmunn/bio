# bio
Is this how I am supposed to do this? This is all new for me, and I am very excited to start putting this to use! This is going to come in very handy for many of my classes and projects!
My name is Kristin Munn. I have returned to school to study computer programming after working in the community college setting for the past 16 years. I feel pretty bionic these days, as I had full hip replacements on both of my hips in the past year, which has been a life-changer! I have a 15 year old kitty that is my absolute sweetheart and love, Sophie, who is thankfully by my side, comforting me. I will add a lot more on this bio soon, but right now, I am very sick, and need to go lay down before I fall down.
