Is this how I am supposed to do this? This is all new for me, and I am very excited to start putting this to use!
My name is Kristin Munn. I have returned to school to study computer programming after working in the community college setting for the past 16 years. I feel pretty bionic these days, as I had full hip replacements on both of my hips in the past year, which has been a life-changer!
